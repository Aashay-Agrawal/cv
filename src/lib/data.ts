The best way to define me is â€” I'm just someone you can rent to solve your problems. Basically, my time.

Putting yourself into a single title or label feels like bondage, and I'm not someone who does that. I want to be free. Most of what I do in life is simply following my desires sincerely, just going with the flow wherever it takes me. It's like my self is on a raft, drifting down a river without any external force.`,
